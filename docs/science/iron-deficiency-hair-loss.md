## The Scale of the Problem

Iron deficiency affects an estimated two billion people globally, with premenopausal women at particularly high risk. In the UK, approximately 25% of women of reproductive age have low iron stores, and many are unaware.

What's less widely known is the relationship between iron status and hair health. While severe iron deficiency anaemia has long been recognised as a cause of hair loss, emerging research suggests that even **non-anaemic iron depletion** — low ferritin without full anaemia — can trigger significant hair shedding.

## Understanding the Mechanism

Hair follicle matrix cells have one of the highest proliferation rates of any cell type in the body. This rapid division requires a constant supply of iron for:

- **DNA synthesis** — Iron is a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, essential for cell division
- **Oxygen delivery** — Iron in haemoglobin carries oxygen to the follicle
- **Energy production** — Iron-containing enzymes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain

When iron stores drop, the body triages its limited supply toward essential functions (red blood cell production, oxygen transport to vital organs). Hair follicles — non-essential from a survival standpoint — are deprioritised.

The result is **telogen effluvium**: a diffuse shedding pattern where a disproportionate number of follicles prematurely enter the resting (telogen) phase of the hair cycle.

## The Ferritin Threshold Debate

Ferritin — the protein that stores iron — is the most useful blood marker for assessing iron stores. But what constitutes a "normal" ferritin level for hair health is surprisingly contentious.

Most laboratories report ferritin as normal above **12-15 ng/mL**, a threshold based on anaemia prevention. However, dermatologists and trichologists increasingly argue that the threshold for optimal hair health is significantly higher:

- **Below 30 ng/mL** — Multiple studies associate this level with increased hair shedding
- **30-70 ng/mL** — A grey zone where some individuals experience hair effects
- **Above 70 ng/mL** — Generally considered optimal for hair health by most trichologists

> "A ferritin of 15 is 'normal' by laboratory standards, but I routinely see patients with ferritin levels of 20-30 presenting with significant hair shedding that resolves with iron repletion." — Dr. Sarah Chen

## Key Research Findings

A 2023 systematic review in the *Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology* analysed 14 studies examining the iron-hair loss relationship. Key findings:

- **11 of 14 studies** found a statistically significant association between low ferritin and hair loss
- Women with telogen effluvium had **mean ferritin levels 38% lower** than age-matched controls
- Iron supplementation led to measurable improvement in hair parameters in 8 of 9 intervention studies

The evidence is not unanimous — three studies found no significant association — but the weight of evidence supports a meaningful connection.

## Practical Recommendations

### Testing

If you're experiencing diffuse hair shedding, request a **full iron panel** from your healthcare provider, including:

- Serum ferritin
- Serum iron
- Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)
- Transferrin saturation

A complete blood count (CBC) alone is insufficient, as ferritin can be depleted well before haemoglobin drops.

### Supplementation

If your ferritin is below 30 ng/mL and you're experiencing hair loss, iron supplementation under medical supervision is reasonable. Common approaches include:

- **Ferrous bisglycinate** — Better absorbed and better tolerated than ferrous sulfate
- **Taken with vitamin C** — Enhances non-heme iron absorption
- **Taken on an empty stomach** — Maximises absorption (though some need food to tolerate it)
- **Avoid taking with tea, coffee, or calcium** — These inhibit iron absorption

### Timeline

Iron repletion is a gradual process. Expect:

- **1-2 months** for ferritin levels to begin rising
- **3-4 months** for hair shedding to normalise
- **6-12 months** for full regrowth of shed hair

## Important Caveats

Iron overload is also harmful. Never supplement iron without blood work confirming deficiency, particularly if you have haemochromatosis or other iron metabolism disorders.

Ferritin is also an acute phase reactant — it rises during inflammation, infection, and liver disease. An apparently normal ferritin in someone with concurrent inflammation may actually mask functional iron deficiency.
