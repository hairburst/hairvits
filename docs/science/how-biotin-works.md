## The Basics

Biotin, also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H, is a water-soluble B-vitamin that functions as an essential cofactor for five carboxylase enzymes in the human body. These enzymes are critical for:

- **Fatty acid synthesis** — building the lipids that form cell membranes
- **Amino acid metabolism** — processing the building blocks of protein
- **Gluconeogenesis** — producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources

Without adequate biotin, these metabolic pathways slow down, and the effects become visible in tissues with high cell turnover — including hair, skin, and nails.

## The Hair Connection

Hair is composed primarily of keratin, a fibrous structural protein. Keratin production depends on a steady supply of amino acids and the enzymatic machinery to assemble them. Biotin enters this picture in two key ways:

### 1. Keratin Infrastructure

Biotin-dependent carboxylases are involved in the metabolism of leucine, isoleucine, and valine — branched-chain amino acids that contribute to keratin's structural integrity. When biotin is deficient, keratin synthesis becomes less efficient, leading to brittle, fragile hair.

### 2. Follicle Cell Proliferation

Hair follicle matrix cells are among the fastest-dividing cells in the body. They require robust fatty acid synthesis to build new cell membranes. As a cofactor for acetyl-CoA carboxylase — the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis — biotin directly supports this proliferative capacity.

## The Deficiency Question

Here's where the nuance lies. Clinical biotin deficiency is genuinely rare in healthy adults eating a varied diet. The recommended adequate intake (AI) is just 30 micrograms per day, and biotin is found in eggs, nuts, seeds, salmon, and many other common foods.

However, **subclinical insufficiency** — levels that are technically within normal range but below optimal — may be more common than previously thought. Groups at higher risk include:

- Women during pregnancy and lactation
- Individuals taking certain anticonvulsant medications
- Heavy alcohol consumers
- People with inflammatory bowel conditions
- Those on long-term antibiotic therapy (which can disrupt gut bacterial biotin synthesis)

## What the Studies Say

The evidence for biotin supplementation in hair health falls into three tiers:

**Strong evidence:** Biotin supplementation clearly improves hair quality in individuals with documented biotin deficiency. Multiple case studies and small trials confirm this.

**Moderate evidence:** In individuals with subclinical insufficiency, supplementation may improve hair thickness and reduce shedding. Several small randomised trials support this, though the effect sizes are modest.

**Weak evidence:** For individuals with normal biotin levels, the evidence that supplementation improves hair is limited. A few studies show marginal benefits, but many show no significant effect.

> "The evidence is strongest where deficiency is present. For the general population, biotin's benefits are plausible but not proven at the level we'd like to see." — HairVits Science Review Board

## Dosage Considerations

Most hair supplements contain between 2,500 and 10,000 micrograms of biotin per serving — 83 to 333 times the adequate intake. As a water-soluble vitamin, excess biotin is generally excreted in urine, and no upper limit has been established by regulatory bodies.

However, high-dose biotin supplementation has one well-documented interference: it can cause **falsely abnormal results** on immunoassay-based laboratory tests, including:

- Thyroid function panels (TSH, T3, T4)
- Troponin (cardiac marker)
- Certain hormone assays

If you're taking high-dose biotin, inform your healthcare provider before any blood work.

## The Bottom Line

Biotin plays a genuine, well-characterised role in hair biology. Supplementation is clearly beneficial for those with deficiency and likely beneficial for those with suboptimal levels. For the broader population, it's a reasonable but unproven intervention.

The most honest recommendation: if you're concerned about hair health, a blood test to check your biotin status is more informative than simply starting a supplement.
