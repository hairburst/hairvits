## The Problem With Most Hair Supplements

Walk into any pharmacy or scroll through any wellness site and you'll find dozens of hair growth supplements making bold promises. The vast majority lean on the same tired formula: a modest dose of biotin, maybe some zinc, perhaps a sprinkling of vitamin D, and a lot of marketing. Two capsules a day, minimal active ingredients, and a prayer that something sticks.

The issue isn't that these ingredients are useless — they aren't. It's that they only address one dimension of hair health: basic nutritional deficiency. For many women experiencing thinning, shedding, or noticeable hair loss, the problem runs deeper. Stress, hormonal shifts, chronic low-grade inflammation, poor sleep, and oxidative damage all conspire to disrupt the hair growth cycle long before a vitamin gap enters the picture. A supplement that ignores these root causes is, at best, an expensive multivitamin with good branding.

That's the context in which Hairburst launched their [Advanced+ Hair Formula](https://www.hairburst.com/products/advanced-hair-formula) — and it's why it caught our attention.

## What Makes Advanced+ Different

The most striking thing about Hairburst's Advanced+ formula is its ambition. Where competitors typically offer 8 to 12 ingredients at conservative doses, Advanced+ packs 22 active ingredients across two proprietary blends — Folishield™ and Trichoburst™ — plus a supporting cast of essential vitamins and minerals. The daily dosage is four capsules, which sounds like a lot until you understand the logic: each ingredient needs to reach its clinically studied amount to do anything meaningful. Two-a-day formulas often can't fit enough active material into the capsule to move the needle.

Hairburst's approach is what they call "whole-body" hair health, and it represents a genuine philosophical departure from the norm. Rather than treating hair as an isolated system, the formula targets seven interconnected root causes of hair deterioration: stress, inflammation, hormonal imbalance, ageing, lifestyle factors, nutritional gaps, and metabolic slowdown. Each of these has a well-documented relationship with the hair growth cycle, and addressing them simultaneously is a far more sophisticated strategy than simply topping up biotin levels.

## The Two Proprietary Blends, Explained

### Folishield™: Protect

[![Before and after results from Hairburst's community](/img/before-after-results.png "Before and after results from Hairburst's community")](https://www.hairburst.com/products/advanced-hair-formula?variant=55516134113662&selling_plan=710476792190)

The Folishield™ blend is the defensive arm of the formula. Its role is to create the internal conditions under which healthy hair can actually grow — by supporting the body's stress response, hormonal balance, and antioxidant defences.

The centrepiece here is [KSM-66® Ashwagandha](https://ksm66ashwagandhaa.com/science.php), one of the most rigorously studied adaptogens available. KSM-66 has demonstrated in clinical trials that it can meaningfully reduce cortisol levels, improve sleep quality, and support hormonal equilibrium. For women going through perimenopause, postpartum recovery, or simply navigating a high-stress lifestyle, chronically elevated cortisol is a significant driver of telogen effluvium — the technical term for stress-induced shedding. Anything that brings cortisol down and keeps it down has a direct line to reduced hair loss.

Alongside ashwagandha, Folishield™ includes turmeric paired with black pepper (the latter boosting [turmeric's bioavailability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8572027/) dramatically), reishi mushroom for additional adaptogenic and hormonal support, and a suite of antioxidants — [astaxanthin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655540/), [resveratrol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221009483), elderberry, and [CoQ10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.1492) — that collectively combat the oxidative stress which degrades follicle function over time.

This isn't a token nod toward "wellness." It's a coordinated system designed to lower the biological barriers that prevent hair from growing properly in the first place.

### Trichoburst™: Grow

If Folishield™ clears the path, Trichoburst™ builds the road. This blend focuses directly on follicle nourishment, keratin production, and scalp health.

[MSM (methylsulfonylmethane)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339425301_Beauty_from_within_Oral_administration_of_a_sulfur-containing_supplement_methylsulfonylmethane_improves_signs_of_skin_ageing) is the structural backbone here — a bioavailable sulphur compound that provides the raw material for keratin and collagen synthesis. Clinical research has shown MSM can improve hair thickness, resilience, and overall quality when taken consistently.

The formula also includes a targeted [amino acid blend](https://www.foodandnutritionjournal.org/volume12number1/amino-acids-oral-treatment-for-the-amelioration-of-skin-hair-and-nails-conditions-an-open-label-study/) featuring L-Lysine and other keratin precursors. Hair is, fundamentally, a protein structure — and without the right amino acid building blocks, follicles simply cannot produce strong, well-anchored strands. This is an area where most competing formulas fall short, either omitting amino acids entirely or including them at sub-therapeutic levels.

Supporting these core actives are [vitamin E](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3819075/) (shown in a clinical trial to increase hair count in alopecia patients), biotin, selenium, zinc, vitamins A, C, and D — each chosen not as filler, but because they play specific, documented roles in follicle function, sebum regulation, collagen production, and scalp immunity.

## How It Compares to Leading Competitors

We've reviewed dozens of hair supplements over the past year, and Advanced+ stands apart in several measurable ways.

Most competing formulas — including popular options from Nutrafol, Viviscal, and various high-street brands — work from a narrower ingredient base. They tend to focus on one or two mechanisms (typically nutrition and, in some cases, DHT inhibition) while leaving stress, inflammation, and hormonal disruption largely unaddressed. That's a defensible approach for mild nutritional hair thinning, but it leaves significant gaps for the millions of women whose hair loss has multifactorial origins.

Advanced+ is also notably more transparent about dosing. The four-capsule-per-day format is a feature, not a bug: it allows each ingredient to be included at levels that align with clinical research, rather than being compressed into a two-capsule format where everything is underdosed. When a supplement brand asks you to take fewer capsules per day, the question to ask is not "why so few?" but "what did they leave out?"

The inclusion of trademarked, clinically validated ingredients like KSM-66® Ashwagandha adds another layer of credibility. KSM-66 is not a generic ashwagandha extract — it's a full-spectrum root extract produced to a specific standard, with its own body of published clinical evidence. That level of ingredient specificity signals a formula built on research rather than marketing convenience.

## The Clinical Evidence

Hairburst conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled consumer trial with 129 participants over 90 days. The results were clear: 88% of participants reported their hair looked better, 87% said it looked healthier, and 86% felt their hair was fuller by the end of the trial period.

These are self-reported outcomes rather than trichoscopy measurements, which is worth noting — but a well-designed placebo-controlled trial with over a hundred participants is more rigorous than what the majority of supplement brands offer. Many competitors rely on smaller studies, open-label designs, or no clinical validation at all. The fact that Hairburst invested in a proper blinded study with a meaningful sample size speaks to confidence in the formula.

Beyond the product-level trial, each key ingredient carries its own body of peer-reviewed evidence. The links between [ashwagandha and cortisol reduction](https://ksm66ashwagandhaa.com/science.php), [turmeric and inflammatory markers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8572027/), [astaxanthin and oxidative protection](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655540/), and [MSM and keratin support](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339425301_Beauty_from_within_Oral_administration_of_a_sulfur-containing_supplement_methylsulfonylmethane_improves_signs_of_skin_ageing) are all well-established in the literature. This isn't a formula built on theoretical synergies — it's built on ingredients that have individually proven their worth.

## Pricing and Value

Advanced+ is available on a subscription model, which makes sense given that consistency over 90+ days is essential for any hair supplement to work. The pricing tiers are:

The one-month subscription runs at £54.99 (roughly £1.83 per day). The three-month plan drops to £134.99 (£1.49/day) and includes a free Advanced+ Bond Repair Duo worth £45.99 — making it the most popular option and, in our view, the smartest entry point. The six-month plan comes in at £239.99 (£1.33/day) with a free Multi-Active Hair Growth Serum worth £41.99.

All subscriptions include free priority delivery and can be paused, skipped, or cancelled at any time. The three- and six-month plans also carry a 90-day money-back guarantee, which removes the financial risk entirely for anyone unsure whether the formula will work for them.

Is it more expensive than a basic biotin supplement from the supermarket? Absolutely. But the comparison isn't really fair — you're getting 22 clinically relevant ingredients at effective doses versus a handful of vitamins at unknown potencies. On a cost-per-active-ingredient basis, Advanced+ represents strong value.

## Who It's Best For

Advanced+ is formulated specifically for women experiencing thinning, shedding, or hair loss — particularly those whose concerns are driven by more than simple nutritional deficiency. If you're navigating postpartum recovery, perimenopause, high-stress periods, or noticing age-related changes in density and texture, this is a formula designed with your biology in mind.

It's 100% vegan, gluten-free, GMO-free, and dairy-free, making it suitable for most dietary requirements.

Women who are primarily looking for faster growth of already-healthy hair may find simpler formulas sufficient. But for anyone dealing with the frustrating, confidence-affecting reality of hair that's thinning, breaking, or refusing to grow — the kind of hair loss that has real, internal root causes — Advanced+ is the most comprehensive option we've tested.
