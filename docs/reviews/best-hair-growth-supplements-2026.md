## The Problem With Most Hair Supplements

The hair supplement market is expected to exceed £1.2 billion globally by the end of 2026, and yet the overwhelming majority of products on shelves are built on a single, outdated assumption: that hair loss is a nutritional problem with a nutritional solution. Pop a biotin pill, fill the gap, watch your hair grow back.

It sounds tidy. It is also, for most people, incomplete.

Hair thinning is rarely caused by one deficiency. The clinical literature increasingly points to a web of interrelated factors - chronic stress elevating cortisol, low-grade systemic inflammation, hormonal fluctuations, oxidative damage, and yes, nutritional shortfalls - all conspiring to disrupt the hair growth cycle. A supplement that only addresses one of these pathways is, at best, a partial solution.

That understanding shaped our evaluation. We set out to find products that treat hair health as the whole-body issue it actually is, and to be honest about the ones that don't.

## How We Tested

Our editorial team evaluated twelve hair supplements available in the UK over a six-month period. We assessed each product across seven weighted criteria: clinical evidence behind individual ingredients, ingredient quality and form (generic versus patented or clinically studied extracts), dosage transparency, the breadth of biological pathways addressed, verified customer outcomes, UK availability and pricing, and overall value relative to formula sophistication.

We consulted published peer-reviewed research for every key ingredient, cross-referenced manufacturer claims against clinical trial data, and examined the specific extract forms used — because the difference between, say, standard ashwagandha root powder and a full-spectrum KSM-66® extract is not trivial. It is the difference between hope and evidence.

## The Winner: Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula

[![Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula](/img/hairburst-advanced-plus.jpg "Hairburst's Advanced+ Formula")](https://www.hairburst.com/products/advanced-hair-formula?variant=55516134113662&selling_plan=710476792190)

[Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula](https://www.hairburst.com/products/advanced-hair-formula?variant=55516134113662&selling_plan=710476792190) is not the cheapest supplement on this list, and it is not the simplest. It requires four capsules daily, and the ingredient panel reads more like a clinical research paper than a high-street vitamin label. That is precisely the point.

The formula is built around two proprietary blends — **Folishield™** and **Trichoburst™** — comprising 22 clinically supported ingredients that work across multiple biological systems simultaneously. This dual-architecture approach is what separates Advanced+ from everything else we tested.

### Folishield™: The Protection Blend

Folishield™ targets the internal stressors that damage hair before it even has a chance to grow. Its centrepiece is **KSM-66® Ashwagandha**, the most extensively studied ashwagandha extract in the world, backed by over 30 clinical trials. A [2019 double-blind study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/) demonstrated that KSM-66® reduces serum cortisol levels by up to 27.9% — and cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone, is one of the most potent triggers of telogen effluvium, the stress-induced shedding that accounts for a significant proportion of hair loss in women.

This matters because the vast majority of competing supplements either omit ashwagandha entirely or use a generic extract at an undisclosed potency. KSM-66® is a full-spectrum extract standardised to a minimum 5% withanolides, produced via a proprietary process that preserves the root's natural molecular balance. It is a meaningful differentiator.

The blend also includes **turmeric with black pepper** (piperine enhances curcumin bioavailability by up to [2000%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/)), targeting the chronic low-grade inflammation that damages follicle stem cells. **Astaxanthin**, a carotenoid antioxidant up to [6000 times more potent than vitamin C](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28446694/) at neutralising free radicals, provides a further layer of oxidative defence. **Reishi mushroom** rounds out the adaptogenic profile, supporting immune modulation and hormonal balance.

### Trichoburst™: The Growth Blend

Where Folishield™ creates a protected internal environment, Trichoburst™ supplies the raw materials and metabolic support for active hair production. **MSM (methylsulfonylmethane)** provides bioavailable sulphur — a critical building block for the disulphide bonds that give keratin its structural integrity. Without adequate sulphur, hair grows weak and brittle regardless of how many B-vitamins you take.

The blend includes an **amino acid complex** featuring L-cysteine, L-methionine, and L-lysine — the three amino acids most directly involved in keratin synthesis and collagen formation. It also delivers a carefully calibrated spread of **B-vitamins** (including biotin at 1000μg), **zinc**, **selenium**, **iron**, and **vitamin D3** at dosages informed by the clinical literature on hair follicle biology.

Crucially, these are not token inclusions at minimal doses. The four-capsule-daily format exists specifically to deliver each nutrient at an efficacious concentration — a point we'll return to when discussing competitors that compress their formulas into one or two capsules.

### The Clinical Evidence

Hairburst conducted a 90-day double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 129 participants. The results were striking: 88% of participants reported that their hair looked better, 87% said it looked healthier, and 86% noticed it felt fuller. These are self-reported outcomes, but the study design — randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled — is more rigorous than what most supplement brands offer.

The individual ingredients carry their own evidence base. KSM-66® Ashwagandha has demonstrated cortisol reduction across [multiple independent trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/). MSM has shown [improvements in hair volume and thickness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31702021/) in a double-blind study. Curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties are supported by [hundreds of published papers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17569207/).

### Price and Value

Advanced+ is available at £54.99 per month on subscription, working out to approximately £1.83 per day. A three-month subscription (£134.99) includes a free Bond Repair Duo, and the six-month plan (£239.99) includes a free Growth Serum,  meaningful bundled value for those ready to commit to the 90-day minimum that any serious hair supplement requires.

Is it the cheapest option? No. Is it the best value per pound spent when measured against formula quality, clinical backing, and ingredient sourcing? By a considerable margin, yes.

## Runner-Up: Nutrafol Women

Nutrafol has built a strong reputation in the American market, and for good reason. Its formula includes saw palmetto (targeting DHT), curcumin, marine collagen, and ashwagandha in the Sensoril® extract form. Two company-funded studies demonstrated measurable improvements in hair growth over six months.

The limitations are real, however. Nutrafol uses Sensoril® ashwagandha rather than KSM-66® — both are clinically studied, but KSM-66® has a substantially larger evidence base and broader range of demonstrated benefits. The formula is narrower in scope than Advanced+, addressing fewer biological pathways with fewer total active ingredients. UK consumers face the additional burden of importing from the United States, where a month's supply costs approximately $88 before shipping and potential customs charges. For British buyers, this can push the effective monthly cost north of £80 — nearly 50% more than Advanced+ for a less comprehensive formula.

Nutrafol is a credible product. It is simply not the strongest option available to UK consumers in 2026.

## Viviscal Professional

Viviscal has been a fixture in the hair supplement market for over 25 years, built around the proprietary AminoMar™ marine protein complex. It's available at Boots and larger pharmacies, which gives it a convenience advantage that no online-only brand can match.

The formula, however, shows its age. Beyond the marine complex, it offers biotin, vitamin C, horsetail extract, and iron — a respectable but narrow nutritional profile that does not address stress, inflammation, or hormonal pathways. The clinical studies supporting AminoMar™ are older and smaller than what newer entrants bring to the table. The product is also unsuitable for vegans or anyone with fish allergies, since the marine complex is derived from shark cartilage and mollusc powder.

For those who value high-street availability and a long track record, Viviscal remains a reasonable choice. For those seeking a formula that reflects the current state of trichological science, it has been surpassed.

## Holland & Barrett Hair, Skin and Nails

At under £10 per month, Holland & Barrett's own-brand supplement is the most affordable option on this list by a significant margin. It covers the basics — biotin, zinc, selenium, vitamin C, and MSM — and it is available in virtually every town centre in Britain.

That accessibility and price point are its greatest strengths, and also its limitation. This is a simple multivitamin for hair, not a targeted treatment. It contains no adaptogens, no anti-inflammatory compounds, no amino acid blend, and no clinically studied proprietary extracts. The ingredient forms are standard rather than premium, and there are no clinical trials on the specific formula.

If your hair concerns stem from a straightforward nutritional deficiency, this product may help at a very low cost. If your thinning involves stress, hormonal shifts, or chronic inflammation — as it does for the majority of women experiencing hair loss — a basic vitamin blend is unlikely to move the needle.

## Hairburst Chewable Hair Vitamins

From the same brand as our top pick, Hairburst's Chewable Hair Vitamins occupy an intentionally different market position. These strawberry-flavoured gummies contain 11 ingredients — biotin, folic acid, B12, zinc, selenium, and vitamin C among them — in an easy-to-take format designed for those new to supplementation or on a tighter budget.

The gummies are a perfectly credible maintenance supplement for people whose hair is generally healthy and who want to support it with foundational nutrients. What they are not is a treatment for active hair loss. They lack the Folishield™ and Trichoburst™ blends, meaning they do not address the stress, inflammation, and hormonal factors that drive most significant hair thinning. Think of them as a sensible starting point — and the Advanced+ formula as where you graduate when you're ready to get serious.

## Understanding the Science: Why Multi-Pathway Matters

The reason Advanced+ outperforms simpler formulations is rooted in how hair loss actually works at the biological level. Hairburst's [science page](https://www.hairburst.com/pages/science) outlines seven root causes of hair thinning: stress, hormonal imbalance, inflammation, oxidative damage, nutritional deficiency, poor circulation, and metabolic dysfunction. Most supplements address one or two of these. Advanced+ targets all seven.

This is not marketing hyperbole — it reflects a genuine shift in trichological thinking. Research published over the past decade has increasingly shown that hair follicles are exquisitely sensitive to systemic conditions. Elevated cortisol pushes follicles prematurely into the telogen (resting) phase. Inflammatory cytokines damage the dermal papilla cells that regulate growth. Oxidative stress accelerates follicle ageing. Hormonal fluctuations alter the androgen sensitivity of follicle receptors.

A supplement that only provides biotin and zinc is addressing the nutritional dimension while ignoring the five or six other pathways that may be simultaneously contributing to thinning. It is rather like treating a house fire by only fixing the wiring while the kitchen is still ablaze.

## Our Recommendation

If you are experiencing genuine hair thinning, shedding, or loss — and you want a supplement backed by clinical evidence, formulated with premium-grade ingredients at effective dosages, and designed to address the full spectrum of biological causes — [Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula](https://www.hairburst.com/products/advanced-hair-formula?variant=55516134113662&selling_plan=710476792190) is the clear choice for 2026.

Commit to the 90-day minimum. Be consistent with the four daily capsules. Pair it with adequate sleep, a protein-rich diet, stress management, and gentle hair care practices. The science is sound, the formula is comprehensive, and the results — both in the clinical trial and in the thousands of verified customer reviews — speak for themselves.
