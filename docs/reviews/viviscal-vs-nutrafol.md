## The Contenders

**Viviscal** has been on the market since the 1990s, built around a proprietary marine protein complex called AminoMar. It positions itself as a scientifically backed, single-pathway supplement focused on nourishing hair from within.

**Nutrafol** entered the market in 2016 with a more contemporary, multi-target approach. It combines botanical extracts, adaptogens, and vitamins to address what it calls the "root causes" of hair thinning — stress, hormones, nutrition, and environment.

## Ingredients Compared

| Component | Viviscal | Nutrafol |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Core ingredient | AminoMar (shark cartilage + mollusc powder) | Synergen Complex (saw palmetto, maca, astaxanthin) |
| Biotin | 120mcg | 3000mcg |
| Collagen | Marine-derived (in AminoMar) | Marine collagen peptides |
| Adaptogens | None | Ashwagandha (Sensoril) |
| Anti-inflammatory | None | Curcumin (Meriva) |
| Vitamin E | None | Tocotrienol complex |
| Daily dose | 2 tablets | 4 capsules |
| Allergens | Contains fish, shellfish | Contains fish |

## Clinical Evidence

Both brands have invested in clinical trials, which is more than can be said for most hair supplements.

**Viviscal** has the longer track record with seven published studies spanning over two decades. The research consistently shows modest improvements in hair density and thickness over 3-6 months. The studies are generally small but have been conducted across multiple independent research groups.

**Nutrafol** has two published clinical studies showing statistically significant improvements in hair growth and quality. The results are promising, though both studies were industry-funded with modest sample sizes.

Neither supplement has been compared head-to-head in a clinical setting, which means any direct comparison involves some degree of extrapolation.

## Price

| | Viviscal | Nutrafol |
|---|---------|----------|
| Monthly cost (UK) | ~$40 | ~$88 |
| Annual cost | ~$480 | ~$1,056 |
| Cost per daily dose | ~$1.33 | ~$2.93 |

Viviscal is roughly half the price of Nutrafol, which is a significant factor for a supplement that requires consistent long-term use.

## Our Take

<div class="verdict-box">
  <h4>The Verdict</h4>
  <p><strong>Choose Viviscal</strong> if you want a straightforward, well-researched supplement at a reasonable price. It does one thing — nourish hair — and does it with decades of evidence behind it.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Choose Nutrafol</strong> if you want a comprehensive formula that addresses multiple factors (stress, hormones, inflammation) and the higher price is sustainable for you long-term.</p>
</div>

Both are legitimate supplements with genuine research behind them. Neither is a miracle cure, and both require patience — typically three to six months before visible results.
