## Why Biotin?

Biotin (vitamin B7) is the most widely marketed ingredient in hair growth supplements. It plays a genuine role in keratin production, the structural protein that makes up hair, skin, and nails. However, clinical biotin deficiency is rare in healthy adults, which raises an important question: do supplements actually help?

The short answer is nuanced. For individuals with suboptimal biotin levels — more common than outright deficiency — supplementation may support hair quality. For those with adequate levels, the benefits are less clear.

> "Biotin supplementation is most impactful for individuals with measurable deficiency. For the general population, the evidence is promising but not conclusive." — Dr. Sarah Chen, Trichologist

## Our Testing Methodology

Each supplement was evaluated on five criteria:

- **Potency accuracy** — Does the capsule contain the amount stated on the label?
- **Purity** — Tested for heavy metals, microbes, and undeclared ingredients
- **Bioavailability** — Form of biotin used (D-biotin is the active form)
- **Value** — Cost per effective dose
- **Formulation** — Additional ingredients, fillers, and allergens

Third-party testing was conducted by an ISO 17025-accredited laboratory.

## The Results

### 1. Thorne Biotin-8

A trusted heritage brand delivering reliable results. Vegetable capsule format suitable for vegetarians. Slightly lower potency accuracy (94.8%) than top picks.

### 5. NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg

## The Bottom Line

If purity and potency are your priority, **Thorne Biotin-8** is the clear winner. For most people seeking a reliable daily biotin supplement, **Nature's Bounty** offers the best balance of quality and value.

Before starting any supplement regimen, consult your healthcare provider — particularly if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking medications. Biotin can also interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid panels and troponin assays.
