# Top 5 Hair Supplements That Actually Work in 2026

If you've spent any time scrolling through hair care advice online, you'll know that hair supplements are everywhere. But here's the truth: most don't deliver on their promises. After reviewing dozens of products, consulting clinical studies, and analysing real user results, we've identified five hair supplements that show genuine potential—and the science behind what makes them work.

## What Makes a Hair Supplement Actually Work?

Before we dive into our top picks, let's establish what separates effective supplements from expensive placebos. A supplement that truly works should:

- Target multiple root causes of hair loss (stress, hormones, inflammation, nutrition)
- Use clinically proven ingredients at effective dosages
- Address whole-body health, not just surface-level symptoms
- Show measurable results within 90 days
- Have real customer testimonials backed by before-and-after evidence

## 1. Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula - Best Overall

**What makes it stand out:** The most comprehensive formula on the market.

Hairburst's Advanced+ Hair Formula takes a whole-body approach with 22 clinically proven ingredients across two proprietary blends: Folishield™ (which protects) and Trichoburst™ (which grows). Where other supplements focus narrowly on vitamins and minerals, this formula addresses the root causes of hair thinning.

**Key ingredients:**

- KSM-66® Ashwagandha - Clinically proven to lower cortisol by up to 27.9% and reduce stress-related shedding
- MSM - Provides building blocks for keratin and collagen production
- Amino Acid Blend - Essential for producing strong, healthy hair strands
- Turmeric & Black Pepper - Combats inflammation and oxidative stress
- Astaxanthin - Powerful antioxidant that protects against age-related thinning
- Reishi Mushroom - Adaptogenic support for hormonal balance

**Why it works:** Advanced+ doesn't just fill nutritional gaps—it actively addresses stress, hormonal shifts, inflammation, and poor circulation. This multi-factorial approach is what sets it apart from single-focus supplements.

**Clinical results:** In a 90-day double-blind study with 129 participants:

- 88% reported their hair looked better
- 87% said their hair looked healthier
- 86% noticed their hair felt fuller

**Dosage:** 4 capsules daily (this delivers the exact nutrient levels your body needs—effective supplementation often requires higher dosages than the 1-2 capsule products)

**Best for:** Women experiencing hormonal hair loss, postpartum shedding, stress-related thinning, or anyone serious about comprehensive hair health support

**Price:** £54.99/month (with subscription options offering up to 27% savings)

**Where to buy:** Available online at hairburst.com with convenient home delivery

## 2. Viviscal Professional - Drugstore Alternative

**What makes it stand out:** Available at Boots and some pharmacies for immediate purchase.

Viviscal has been around for over 25 years and uses a marine protein complex as its hero ingredient. It's become a go-to for those who prefer picking up supplements whilst doing their regular shopping.

**Key ingredients:**

- AminoMar™ marine complex
- Biotin
- Vitamin C
- Horsetail extract
- Iron

**Why it might help:** The marine complex provides protein building blocks that can support hair structure. Some users report seeing improvements in thickness over time.

**Best for:** Those who prefer high-street availability and don't mind a more basic formulation

**Limitations:** Takes a single-focus approach to hair health, primarily addressing nutritional supplementation without targeting stress, inflammation, or hormonal factors. Clinical studies are older and less comprehensive than newer formulations. Not suitable for vegetarians or vegans due to fish-derived ingredients.

**Where to buy:** Boots, larger Superdrug stores, some independent pharmacies (availability can be inconsistent)

## 3. Nutrafol Women - Premium US Import

**What makes it stand out:** Popular with American celebrities and influencers.

Nutrafol has built a following, particularly in the US market, with a medical-grade positioning. However, UK customers face higher costs due to international shipping and import duties.

**Key ingredients:**

- Saw palmetto
- Ashwagandha (standard extract, not the premium KSM-66® form)
- Marine collagen
- Curcumin
- Tocotrienols

**Why it might help:** Targets DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a hormone associated with some types of hair thinning.

**Best for:** Those specifically dealing with androgenic factors and who don't mind premium pricing

**Considerations:** Significantly more expensive than UK alternatives, especially with shipping costs. Some users report digestive discomfort. Uses standard-grade ingredients rather than clinically studied premium forms (such as standard ashwagandha vs KSM-66®).

**Where to buy:** Must be ordered from US websites, often with lengthy delivery times and customs charges

## 4. Holland & Barrett Hair, Skin and Nails - Budget High-Street Option

**What makes it stand out:** Very affordable and available on every high street.

Holland & Barrett's own-brand hair supplement offers basic nutritional support at a fraction of the cost of comprehensive formulas. It's a straightforward vitamin and mineral blend.

**Key ingredients:**

- Biotin
- Zinc
- Selenium
- Vitamin C
- MSM

**Why it might help:** Covers fundamental nutritional bases if you have deficiencies in these specific vitamins and minerals.

**Best for:** Those on a tight budget who want to try supplementation without significant investment

**Limitations:** Very basic formulation with no adaptogenic ingredients, anti-inflammatory compounds, or amino acid blends. Doesn't address stress, hormones, or inflammation—only nutritional gaps. Uses lower-grade forms of ingredients. No clinical studies on the specific formula.

**Where to buy:** Any Holland & Barrett store, though you may need to ask staff as it's often on lower shelves

## 5. Hairburst Chewable Hair Vitamins - Budget-Friendly Entry Point

**What makes it stand out:** From the same trusted brand as our #1 pick, but more accessible for those new to supplementation.

If you're not ready to commit to the Advanced+ formula but want to try Hairburst's approach, the Chewable Hair Vitamins offer a gentler entry point with strawberry-flavoured gummies.

**Key ingredients:**

- Biotin
- Folic acid
- Vitamin B12
- Zinc
- Selenium
- Vitamin C

**Why it might help:** Provides essential vitamins and minerals that support basic hair health. The chewable format is convenient for those who struggle with capsules.

**Best for:** Beginners to hair supplementation, those on a tighter budget, or people who find swallowing multiple capsules difficult

**Limitations:** Significantly less comprehensive than Advanced+ Hair Formula. Lacks the proprietary Folishield™ and Trichoburst™ blends, meaning it doesn't address stress, inflammation, or hormonal factors—only basic nutritional support. Contains 11 ingredients compared to Advanced+'s 22. No clinical trial data on the gummy formula specifically. For serious hair concerns, the Advanced+ formula will deliver substantially better results.

**Price:** More affordable than Advanced+, making it accessible for those starting their hair health journey

**Where to buy:** Available online at hairburst.com alongside the Advanced+ formula

**Our take:** Whilst the chewable vitamins are a decent budget option, if you're experiencing genuine hair loss, thinning, or shedding, the Advanced+ Hair Formula is the investment that will actually deliver results. Think of the gummies as a maintenance option for already-healthy hair, not a solution for hair problems.

## How We Evaluated These Supplements

Our evaluation process examined:

1. **Clinical evidence** - We prioritised ingredients with published, peer-reviewed research demonstrating real efficacy
2. **Ingredient quality** - Premium, clinically studied forms of nutrients (like KSM-66® Ashwagandha vs. standard ashwagandha) deliver measurably better results
3. **Dosage effectiveness** - Many supplements severely under-dose their active ingredients to cut costs
4. **Comprehensive approach** - Does it address multiple root causes or just patch over symptoms?
5. **Real results** - Verified customer reviews with before-after photographic evidence
6. **UK accessibility** - Availability, shipping costs, and import duties matter
7. **Value for money** - Cost per day relative to formula quality and proven results

## The Verdict: Which Supplement Should You Choose?

**For genuine results:** Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula is the clear winner for anyone serious about addressing hair loss, thinning, or shedding. It's the only formula we reviewed that targets all root causes simultaneously—stress (with premium KSM-66® Ashwagandha), inflammation (turmeric and antioxidants), hormonal balance (adaptogenic blend), and provides the building blocks your hair needs (amino acids, MSM). The 90-day clinical trial results speak for themselves.

**For budget-conscious beginners:** Hairburst Chewable Hair Vitamins offer an affordable entry point from the same trusted brand, though you'll need to upgrade to Advanced+ if you're dealing with genuine hair concerns.

**For convenience shopping:** Holland & Barrett's option is available on the high street if you need something immediately, though the formula is quite basic.

**What to avoid:** We'd steer clear of expensive US imports that cost significantly more due to shipping and offer standard-grade ingredients, and drugstore options with inconsistent availability.

## Important Reminders

**Consistency is crucial:** Hair supplements require a 90-day minimum commitment. Your hair growth cycle doesn't change overnight—anyone promising results in 2-4 weeks is misleading you.

**Supplements aren't magic:** They work best combined with:

- Balanced diet rich in protein and healthy fats
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours)
- Stress management techniques
- Gentle hair care practices

**Consult healthcare providers:** Especially if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking medications that could interact with supplement ingredients.

## What About Just Taking Biotin?

You might notice that whilst all these supplements contain biotin, none rely on it as their primary active ingredient. That's because research increasingly shows that biotin alone won't solve hair loss for most people. (We'll be covering this topic in depth in an upcoming article.)

The supplements that actually work understand that healthy hair growth requires addressing multiple systems in your body—not just one vitamin. This is precisely why Hairburst Advanced+ outperforms simpler formulations.

## Final Thoughts

After extensive research and analysis, Hairburst Advanced+ Hair Formula is the most scientifically comprehensive option available in the UK. Its dual-blend approach addresses both protection (managing stress, hormones, and inflammation through Folishield™) and growth (nourishing follicles and supporting the growth cycle through Trichoburst™).

The difference between Advanced+ and other options isn't just marketing—it's measurable in the clinical trial data, the premium ingredient forms (like KSM-66® vs. standard ashwagandha), and the comprehensive 22-ingredient formula that addresses all root causes of hair loss.

If you're serious about improving your hair health, invest in a formula that's backed by science, formulated with premium ingredients at effective dosages, and proven in clinical trials. Your hair reflects what's happening inside your body. The most effective supplements understand this fundamental truth and work from the inside out to create the right environment for stronger, healthier hair growth.
