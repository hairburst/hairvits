## The Collagen Promise

Walk into any beauty retailer and you'll find collagen in powders, capsules, gummies, drinks, and bars. The marketing is consistent: consume collagen peptides, and your body will use them to build stronger hair, smoother skin, and healthier nails.

It's an appealing narrative. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, providing structure to skin, hair, bones, and connective tissue. As we age, collagen production declines — roughly 1% per year after age 25. The logic of replacing what we're losing seems straightforward.

But biology is rarely straightforward.

## How Collagen Digestion Works

When you swallow collagen peptides, they don't travel intact to your skin or hair. Like all dietary proteins, collagen is broken down in the digestive tract:

1. Stomach acid and pepsin fragment the collagen into smaller peptides
2. Pancreatic enzymes further break these into di- and tripeptides
3. These small peptides are absorbed in the small intestine
4. They enter the bloodstream as amino acids and small peptide fragments

The key question is whether these fragments preferentially reach the skin and hair follicles — and whether the body uses them to synthesise new collagen rather than simply metabolising them for general protein needs.

## What the Research Shows

### For Skin

The evidence for skin is the strongest. Several randomised controlled trials have demonstrated:

- **Improved skin hydration** — A 2019 meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n=805) found that collagen supplementation significantly improved skin hydration and elasticity compared to placebo
- **Reduced wrinkle depth** — Multiple studies show modest but statistically significant improvements in fine lines after 8-12 weeks of supplementation
- **Proposed mechanism** — Collagen-derived peptides (particularly prolyl-hydroxyproline and hydroxyprolyl-glycine) may stimulate fibroblasts to produce new collagen, rather than serving as direct building blocks

The skin evidence is legitimate, though effect sizes are modest and most studies use doses of 2.5-10g daily.

### For Hair

The evidence for hair is considerably weaker:

- **No large RCTs** specifically examining collagen supplementation for hair growth or quality
- **One small study** (2020, n=44) found that a collagen supplement improved self-reported hair thickness after 90 days, but objective measurements were not statistically significant
- **Theoretical support** — collagen provides proline and glycine, amino acids used in keratin synthesis, but these are readily available from any protein source

> "There's no compelling evidence that collagen supplements specifically benefit hair more than any other adequate protein source. The hair marketing rides on the skin data." — HairVits Science Review Board

### For Nails

The nail evidence falls between skin and hair:

- A 2017 study (n=25) found that 2.5g of collagen peptides daily for 24 weeks increased nail growth rate by 12% and decreased nail breakage by 42%
- The results are promising but from a single, small study that has not been independently replicated

## The Quality Question

Beyond efficacy, there are formulation concerns:

**Source matters** — Marine collagen (from fish) contains predominantly Type I collagen, which is most relevant to skin and hair. Bovine collagen contains both Type I and Type III. Neither has been proven superior for beauty applications.

**Hydrolysis matters** — Collagen peptides should be hydrolysed (enzymatically broken down) to a molecular weight of 2,000-5,000 Daltons for optimal absorption. Many products don't disclose this specification.

**What's added** — Many collagen supplements include added biotin, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and other ingredients. Any observed benefits may be attributable to these additions rather than the collagen itself.

## Our Assessment

<div class="verdict-box">
  <h4>The Evidence Summary</h4>
  <p><strong>For skin:</strong> Moderate evidence of modest benefits. Reasonable to try if you're interested.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>For hair:</strong> Insufficient evidence to recommend specifically for hair. Adequate protein from any source is likely equivalent.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>For nails:</strong> Preliminary positive evidence, but limited to one small study.</p>
</div>

## A Practical View

Collagen supplements are generally safe, well-tolerated, and unlikely to cause harm. If you enjoy them and can afford the ongoing cost ($30-80/month for quality products), there's no strong reason to stop — particularly if you've noticed skin improvements.

However, if your primary goal is hair health, your money is likely better spent on:

- Ensuring adequate total protein intake (0.8-1g per kg body weight daily)
- Addressing any specific nutrient deficiencies (iron, biotin, zinc, vitamin D)
- A good scalp care routine
- Evidence-based hair-specific supplements if indicated

The collagen industry has built a compelling brand narrative, but for hair specifically, the evidence doesn't yet justify the premium.
