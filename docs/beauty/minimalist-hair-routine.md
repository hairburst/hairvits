## The Problem with More

The average consumer uses between four and seven hair care products. Shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, heat protectant, serum, oil, mask, dry shampoo — the list grows every year as the industry introduces new product categories.

But more products mean more potential for ingredient conflicts, scalp irritation, product buildup, and — frankly — wasted money. Many of these products solve problems created by other products in the routine.

## The Three-Step Framework

After consulting with six dermatologists and four editorial stylists, we've distilled the essential hair care routine into three non-negotiable steps.

### Step 1: Cleanse (The Right Way)

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week for most hair types; adjust based on your scalp's oil production.

Choose a **sulphate-free shampoo** with a pH between 4.5 and 5.5 (matching the scalp's natural pH). Apply primarily to the scalp, not the lengths — the scalp is what needs cleansing, and the runoff is sufficient for mid-lengths and ends.

**What to avoid:**
- Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) — overly stripping for most people
- Washing daily unless your scalp genuinely requires it
- "Clarifying" shampoos more than once a month

**What to look for:**
- Cocamidopropyl betaine or sodium cocoyl isethionate as primary surfactants
- Scalp-soothing ingredients like niacinamide, piroctone olamine, or zinc pyrithione if you have flaking

### Step 2: Condition (Strategically)

**Frequency:** Every wash, applied to mid-lengths and ends only.

Conditioner's job is simple: smooth the hair cuticle, reduce friction, and prevent mechanical damage during detangling. Apply from mid-lengths to ends, leave for 2-3 minutes, and rinse with cool water to help seal the cuticle.

**The deep conditioning exception:** Once a week (or fortnightly for fine hair), substitute your regular conditioner with a richer mask or deep conditioner. Leave for 5-10 minutes. This is the one "extra" step that genuinely earns its place.

### Step 3: Protect

**When:** Before any heat styling, and ideally as a daily step if your hair is exposed to sun or environmental pollution.

A lightweight leave-in with heat protection is the single most impactful product you can add to a basic routine. Heat damage from styling tools is cumulative and largely irreversible in existing hair — prevention is the only effective strategy.

**Look for:**
- Silicone-based heat protectants (dimethicone, cyclomethicone) for blow-drying and flat ironing
- Minimum SPF or UV filter for sun exposure
- Lightweight formulas that won't weigh hair down

## What You Can Skip

If your routine contains any of the following, they're likely unnecessary for most people:

- **Hair oils applied before washing** ("pre-poo") — limited evidence of benefit
- **Multiple leave-in products** — one well-formulated product does the job
- **Expensive scalp scrubs** — gentle shampoo massage achieves the same exfoliation
- **Silk amino acid sprays, keratin mists, etc.** — usually cosmetic film-formers with no lasting structural benefit

## The Investment

A minimalist routine should cost less, not more. Three well-chosen products — a good shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in protectant — should run between $30-60 total, lasting 2-3 months.

Compare that to the $100+ many people spend monthly on multi-step routines with marginal incremental benefit.

> "The best hair care routine is one you'll actually follow consistently. Three products, used correctly, will outperform ten products used sporadically." — Dr. Rachel Kim, Dermatologist

## The Bottom Line

Good hair care isn't about having the most products — it's about using the right ones correctly. Cleanse your scalp gently, condition your ends, protect from damage. Everything else is optional.
